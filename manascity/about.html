                                    <p>It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you to CIS. To be leading an organization
                                        as prestigious as CIS, is a privilege.
                                        The school works on the ideologies of ipsative learning i.e. to compete with
                                        self. We aim to provide every child with
                                        intrinsic motivation the child himself wants to study more. The school believes
                                        where that the child himself is his
                                        biggest competition and has given birth to four acts- Assessments for Learning,
                                        Child-centric books, Training that
                                        sticks and Service, which leads to measurable improvement in the child. As the
                                        leader of the institution I ensure best
                                        standard of education and personal development of students and the institutions
                                        grows up to be the best school in
